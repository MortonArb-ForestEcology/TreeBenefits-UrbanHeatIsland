**Abstract:** Most cities worldwide experience urban heat islands (UHI), and warmer metropolitan areas are associated with lower tree cover than the surrounding region. However, the cooling capacity of urban trees as nature-based solutions for mitigating UHIs at global scales remains unresolved. We analyzed annual surface temperature and vegetation cover in 2,047 cities between 2001 and 2020 and found that trees have a strong cooling effect in all major biomes and are five times more effective at cooling than other vegetation. However, urban tree cover would need to more than double to fully mitigate UHIs. Furthermore, UHI intensification and regional warming outpaced observed tree cover growth by 5 and 10 times respectively. Growing urban green infrastructure is critically needed to ameliorate urban heat challenges worldwide.

**One-Sentence Summary:** Trees are highly effective at cooling urban areas, and urban forest growth is necessary to slow warming trends.

All data is publicly accessible through the sources cited in the manuscript.  Scripts are numbered in the order to be exectued.  Note: All scripts are workflows that are designed to be worked interactively as numbers are generated within them.  The final script (script 7) largely follows the order of the submitted manuscript with specific language from the manuscript to aid in transprency of how particular values were calculated.
